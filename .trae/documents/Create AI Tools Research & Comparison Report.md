I have researched the current landscape of AI editors, plugins, and CLI tools, specifically focusing on those with Claude integration.

Here is the plan to document this information for you:

1.  **Create Directory**: Create a new folder named `AI_Tools_Research` in your current workspace (`D:\11`).
2.  **Create Report**: Inside this folder, create a Markdown file named `Claude_Integration_Analysis.md`.
3.  **Populate Content**: Write a comprehensive analysis into this file, including:
    *   **AI Editors (IDEs)**: Detailed look at **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and **Trae**, highlighting their native Claude integration and "AI-first" capabilities.
    *   **Plugins/Extensions**: Analysis of **Cline** (Autonomous Agent), **Sourcegraph Cody**, and **Continue**, focusing on their flexibility in model selection.
    *   **CLI Tools**: Examination of **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI) and **Aider**, emphasizing their agentic and headless coding strengths.
    *   **Comparison Table**: A structured table comparing:
        *   Tool Name & Type
        *   Claude Integration Method (Native vs. API)
        *   Key Advantages (e.g., Multi-file editing, Git integration, Context awareness)
        *   Best Use Case

This file will serve as your guide to choosing the right tool for your workflow.
